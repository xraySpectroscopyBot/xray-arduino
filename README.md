# xray-arduino

This sketch is available for the Arduino Nano or the Arduino Pro Micro.

If you want to modify this sketch, to run on your own Arduino, I'd suggest using the Arduino Pro Micro Version, because it's features are required to use the newer [xray-tk](https://github.com/xraySpectroscopyBot/xray-tk).

## Installation
Just download the sketch and upload using the Arduino-IDE
